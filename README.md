## GO MCR Overview
This site has been created to be a guide for potential visitors to Manchester, or local residents, to find a selection of activities to do, places to eat, or accomodation within the city.

This site has been designed to be easy to navigate and for users to find something that takes their fancy.

### User stories

**Prospective visitor 3**

Even the local residents don't know everything... this site should allow them to look for some fun activities in the area, and maybe even grab a nice bite to eat.

**Prospective visitor 4**
Business Tripper:

Whether a frequent commuter, or just someone on a one off business trip, there should be no issues finding a place to eat, or a comfortable nights sleep.

### Strategy

The key design principle of this site, is to have minimal text, and be very visual. 
Each of the prospective customers wants to be able to see the places they want to visit, without it being overcrowded by lots of text.
The site should also be very intuitive, and have clear navigation based on the visitors requirements.

### Scope

The scope was to cater for a variety of vistors, and be able to display a range of places to visit. 

The key areas identified that a visitor might be looking for were:

1. Activities / things to do
2. Places to eat and drink.
3. Accomodation / places to stay over

### Structure

Given the strategy to have clear navigation based on the user preference, the landing screen was designed to have 3 clear options (as detailed in the scope) that a user can select to view more detail.

Depending on which option is selected, the site will display a variety of locations that the user can then also select, which will display further information about that location, including a marked map.
