# CI-MilestoneProjectTwo

## GO MCR Overview
This site has been created to be a guide for potential visitors to Manchester, or local residents, to find a selection of activities to do, places to eat, or accomodation within the city.

This site has been designed to be easy to navigate and for users to find something that takes their fancy.

### User stories

**Prospective visitor 1** 
A party of friends for a social day out:

This group is looking for a fun day out for some food and drinks, also with the possibility of a fun activity or two.

**Prospective visitor 2**
A couple looking for a weekend away:

These visitors are looking for some enjoyable activities to make the most of their weekend, as well as finding some nice places to eat and accomodation to suit.

**Prospective visitor 3**
Local resident looking to try something new:

Even the local residents don't know everything... this site should allow them to look for some fun activities in the area, and maybe even grab a nice bite to eat.

**Prospective visitor 4**
A working professional on a business trip:

Whether a frequent commuter, or just someone on a one off business trip, this visitor is just looking for a new a place to eat, or find a new home away from home.

### Strategy

The key design principle of this site, is to have minimal text, and be very visual. 
Each of the prospective customers wants to be able to see the places they want to visit, without it being overcrowded by lots of text.
The site should also be very intuitive, and have clear navigation based on the visitors requirements.

### Scope

The scope was to cater for a variety of vistors, and be able to display a range of places to visit. 

The key areas identified that a visitor might be looking for were:

1. Activities / things to do
2. Places to eat and drink.
3. Accomodation / places to stay over

### Structure

Given the strategy to have clear navigation based on the user preference, the landing screen was designed to have 3 clear options (as detailed in the scope) that a user can select to view more detail.

Depending on which option is selected, the site will display a variety of locations that the user can then also select, which will display further information about that location, including a marked map.

## Features

## Future Features to implement

## Testing


## Deployment
The site is deployed on GitHub. 

1. Create a git hub repository.
2. Open in GitPod
3. Create index.html file.
4. Add the file to staging area using the command git add index.html (or git add .)
5. We then want to commit the file, with the command git commit -m "Intial commit" (standard practice for the first commit into a repository).
6. We then want to push the file back to the repository, which can be done with the command git push.
7. You should now be able to see this commit in your repository.
8. You can repeat steps 5-7 for any further updates to the file (though your git commit message should contain more detail regarding the updates).
9. In your repository, select the settings option.
10. Scroll Down to the github pages section and click on the dropdown option under source, and select master branch.
11. This now publishes the site, and provides the URL to that published site.

The site can also be ran locally by creating a clone of this repository. In the git hub repository, click on the clone or download button and copy the URL.

Within a new git terminal, you can clone the project with the command git clone "Copied URL"

I used [VisitManchester](https://www.visitmanchester.com/) for inspiration on design and locations to choose for my own site.
I used [api.jquery](https://api.jquery.com/) for guidance on formatting of the functions implemented within my site (particularly for the $.each() function which allowed me to iterate through my JSON data to dynamically populate location details).
I have been watching the 'JavaScript: From Fundamentals to Functional JS' course on [Pluralsight](https://app.pluralsight.com/id/) by Bianca Gandolfo to supplement my learning from the Code Institute.
